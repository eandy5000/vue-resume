	<h2>About This Website</h2>
	<p>The best way to view this page is built and tested with a Google Chrome browser.</p>
	<strong>Front End Javascript</strong>
	<p>This website is a Single Page Application, that uses ES6 Javascript with Babel and Vue JS. It uses Vue-Router for page routing and Vuex for managing state.</p>
	<strong>Styles</strong>
	<p>The website uses custom CSS styles with Flexbox to make a responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile users. It also uses PostCSS and Normalize CSS to improve cross browser experience and Vue's CSS scoping feature to make components with modular styling.</p>
	<strong>Build and Deploy</strong>
	<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli">Vue Cli</a> to generate the boilerplate for this project. I used Node JS with the Express framework to serve the site and <a href="https://surge.sh/">Surge</a> to deploy the site.</p>
