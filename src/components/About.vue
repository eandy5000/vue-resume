	<h2>About This Website</h2>
	<p>The best way to view this page is with a Google Chrome browser.</p>
	<strong>Front End Javascript</strong>
	<p>This website is a Single Page Application, that uses ES6 Javascript with Babel and Vue JS. It uses Vue-Router for page routing and Vuex for managing state.</p>
	<strong>Styles</strong>
	<p>The website uses custom CSS styles with Flexbox to make a responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile users. It also uses Normalize CSS to improve cross browser experience and Vue's CSS scoping feature to make components with modular styling.</p>
	<strong>Build and Deploy</strong>
	<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli">Vue Cli</a> to generate the boilerplate for this project. I used Node JS with express to serve the site and <a href="https://surge.sh/">Surge</a> to deploy the site.</p>
